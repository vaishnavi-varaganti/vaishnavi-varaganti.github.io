Create a visually striking, interactive, and immersive portfolio website for a Software Engineer, to be hosted on Replit. This portfolio should feature a modern, futuristic design with smooth animations, high-quality visuals, and engaging user interactions. Focus on creating a standout experience for users while showcasing your work and technical abilities in an innovative way."

Main Features and Sections:

Homepage:

Full-screen Hero Section: Use a dynamic full-width background image/video of coding, tech visuals, or a custom animation. Implement smooth animations that change as users interact (e.g., a subtle typing effect or glitch animation).
Introduction & Catchy Tagline: Your name, professional title ("Software Engineer"), and a short tagline that highlights your passion (e.g., "Building the future with code").
Call-to-Action (CTA) Button: A large, interactive button that directs to your projects or resume. Upon hover, the button could change color or animate with a ripple effect.
Interactive Cursor Effects: A custom cursor design that changes based on interactions (e.g., a glowing circle or typewriter cursor when hovering over links).
About Section:

2D/3D Interactive Timeline or Progress Bars: Showcase your professional journey using animated timelines or skill progression graphs.
Animated Personal Introduction: A rotating 3D avatar or a parallax effect that brings the content to life.
Skills Highlight with Icons: Interactive skill icons that change on hover to display more details or a percentage progress bar showing proficiency.
Modular Card Layout: Each card should animate on hover, revealing more info, such as your coding languages, tools, and frameworks. These cards can be stacked and rearranged dynamically with JS.
Projects Section:

Interactive Grid or Carousel: Show 4-6 featured projects with high-quality thumbnails. Clicking on a project card should expand into a modal window with a full-screen view of the project details, including:
A visually appealing description of the project.
Technologies used and links to live demos or GitHub.
Embedded videos or animated GIFs to show the projects in action.
Use hover effects to animate the cards and make them more engaging (e.g., slight zoom or color transition).
Featured Project Animation: On hover, make each project’s image zoom in slightly or apply a “hover blur” effect to the background.
Skills Section:

Animated Skill Progression: Use progress bars or circular charts that animate to represent your proficiency in various skills. These should dynamically adjust to show different levels when scrolling down.
Tech Stack Visualization: A 3D rendering of tech logos or dynamic icons that animate or shuffle around the screen. You could include JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS, etc., each with a hover effect that displays a tooltip with a short description.
Contact Section:

Interactive Contact Form: Create an elegant contact form with custom input fields that glow when focused. Add validation animations (e.g., field turns green when correctly filled).
Social Media Links: Stylize the social media icons with hover effects. For instance, social media icons could animate or change size when hovered over, or icons could rotate.
Hover-Activated Floating Buttons: Instead of static icons, use floating action buttons that pop up when the user hovers over a specific area of the screen.
Visual Style and Features:

Dark Mode: Implement a dark mode theme by default with a toggle switch for light mode. The toggle button should smoothly transition between the two themes with an animation.
3D Effects: Use libraries like Three.js to integrate 3D elements, such as floating tech logos or rotating code snippets.
Color Scheme: Use futuristic dark tones like deep blues, purples, and blacks combined with vibrant accents in neon or pastel colors for CTA buttons and highlights.
Animations: Utilize GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) or CSS animations to animate elements, providing smooth transitions, fade-ins, and floating effects. Use interactive effects like scroll-triggered animations or parallax scrolling.
Responsive Design:

Mobile-First Approach: Ensure the portfolio is fully responsive and looks amazing on tablets and mobile phones, with elements rearranging gracefully.
Smooth Scroll: Implement smooth scrolling across the entire site, ensuring that users can enjoy the animations without jitteriness.
Technologies:

Frontend Framework: React.js or Vue.js for dynamic rendering of content and smooth transitions.
Animation Libraries: GSAP or Three.js for advanced animations and interactive effects.
Styling: CSS3 (SCSS for modular styles), Flexbox, or CSS Grid for responsive layouts.
Hosting: Host on Replit, using its live preview feature to display the portfolio seamlessly. Use Replit’s backend if needed to implement a contact form with email integration.
Performance Optimization:

Lazy Loading: Use lazy loading for images and videos, ensuring quick load times.
SVG Icons: Use SVGs for crisp visuals that scale well on different screen resolutions.
Code Splitting: Optimize your React or Vue.js build by implementing code splitting for faster loading times.
